## A neural network build with a sequential layer for classifying patients into Side effects or No side effects after undergoing a clinical trial
1. In this notebooks, I created a dummy data about a clical trials of patients and wheather there was a side effect or not.
2. I also build a simple networl of a Sequential layers. There were just two hidden layers in total.
3. After training and testing, I utilised the ConfusionMatrixDisplay api from the tensorflow.keras
4. Finally, I made some demonstration of how to save a and load model using the default save method of keras model
   and also how to save a model with and without it's weights.
